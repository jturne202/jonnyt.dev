                I'm a driven, diligent, passionate software engineer located in Glasgow with over five years of industry experience under my belt. 
                I have experience in almost all aspects of the software development lifecycle, from concept right through to development and delivery. 
                <br/><br/>
                Graduating in 2018 from Glasgow Caledonian University, I excel working within both team environments and autonomously. 
                I am flexible, self-motivated and a thorough communicator. I have strong skills in Java, C#, JavaScript and SQL, though have picked up 
                many technologies across my career and in my own time with personal projects. I am always interested in learning something new, 
                both technical and non-technical!
                <br/><br/>
